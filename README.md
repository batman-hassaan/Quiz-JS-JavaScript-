# Trivia Time: Quiz App 🎮🤓

This project is part of my journey to master JavaScript through hands-on development. ✨ **Trivia Time** is a responsive quiz application designed to provide an interactive and educational experience while showcasing my JavaScript skills. The primary focus is on functionality and learning JavaScript concepts rather than an overly polished design.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For minimal styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and timers.

## 🕊️ How It Works

1. The quiz starts by dynamically displaying the first question from the array.
2. A countdown timer begins, giving users 10 seconds to select an answer.
3. When an answer is selected:
   - The app checks its correctness.
   - Highlights the correct and incorrect answers.
4. If the timer runs out, the app automatically highlights the correct answer.
5. Users can proceed to the next question using the "Next" button.
6. Once all questions are answered, an alert notifies the user of quiz completion, with the option to restart.

## 🔎 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me apply and understand:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating content based on user interaction.
- **Event Handling**: Attaching and managing events for user inputs.
- **Countdown Timers**: Using `setInterval` and `clearInterval` for real-time updates.
- **JavaScript Arrays**: Iterating through an array of questions and options.
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Ensuring a smooth user experience on any device.

- Include a scoring system for better user engagement.
- Implement a leaderboard to track high scores.
- Enhance the visual design for a polished look.
